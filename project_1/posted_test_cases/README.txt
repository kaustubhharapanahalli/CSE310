These are the 38 posted test cases for project 1. 
There are 12 unposted test cases (which are kept
hidden from you), making for 50 test cases total.
Each test case is worth 2 points. Each test case
is all or nothing. There is NO partial credit. To
test your program against all 38 posted test cases,
run the attached bash script run_tests using the
command "./run_tests". If this is your first time
running the bash script, make sure to run the 
command "chmod u+x run_tests" before "./run_tests" 
in order to grant yourself execution permissions.
You only need to do this once.
